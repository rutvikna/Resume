# Sensor Network
- project: Low-power wide-area (LPWA) sensor network based on LoRa™ technology. 
  role: Personal project
  duration: Dec 2019 &mdash; Present
  # url: "#"
  description: <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Design a SX1272 based LoRa node PCB that can be used to interface with different sensors.</li><li>The sensor nodes are connected to a base node (Raspberry Pi interfaced with a Libelium LoRa module) in a star topology.</li><li>The sensor data is transmitted to a cloud server and can be accessed using open-source IoT applications such as thingSpeak™. </li></ul>

# MQTT Logger
- project: Developed a simple browser-based application to monitor the status of IoT devices
  role: Personal project
  duration: Dec 2019
  # url: "#"
  description: <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>A self-directed learning project to better understand AWS and the server side of things.</li><li>Configured a LAMP server on an AWS that logs MQTT messages from the sensor nodes into an SQLite database which can be accessed through a browser-based frontend to view the status of the installed devices, battery level and last measurement.</li></ul>

# Designa and Layout of a 12V regulator
- project: Design and Layout of a 12V Voltage Regulator IC
  role: Course project
  duration: Oct 2015 &mdash; Jan 2016
  # url: "#"
  description: <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Designed a 12V voltage regulator by integrating a two-stage cascaded operational amplifier and a Widlar Bandgap Reference Voltage circuit in Cadence Virtuoso Analog Design Environment.</li><li>Packaged the IC and verified the design by checking for parameters like power dissipation, effect of temperature, varying input voltage etc by running simulations on Cadence ADE.</li></ul>
