# Sensor Network
- project: Low-power wide-area (LPWA) sensor network based on LoRa™ technology. 
  role: Personal project
  # url: "#"
  description: <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Working on designing an SX1272 based LoRa node PCB that can be used to interface with different sensors. The sensor nodes are connected to a base node (Raspberry Pi interfaced with a LoRa HAT) in a star topology.</li><li>The sensor data is transmitted to a cloud server and can be accessed using open-source IoT applications such as thingSpeak™.</li></ul>

# MQTT Logger
- project: Developed a simple browser-based application to monitor the status of IoT devices
  role: Personal project
  # url: "#"
  description: <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>To have a stronger understanding of AWS, I took up a self-directed learning project; Configured a LAMP server that logs MQTT messages from the sensor nodes into an SQLite database which can be accessed through a browser-based frontend to view the status of the installed devices, battery level and last measurement.</li></ul>

# Designa and Layout of a 12V regulator
- project: Design a 12V Voltage Regulator IC
  role: Course project
  duration: Oct 2015 &mdash; Jan 2016
  # url: "#"
  description: <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Designed a 12V voltage regulator by integrating a two-stage cascaded operational amplifier and a Widlar Bandgap Reference Voltage circuit in Cadence Virtuoso Analog Design Environment.</li><li>Packaged the IC and verified the design by checking for parameters like power dissipation, effect of temperature, varying input voltage etc by running simulations on Cadence ADE.</li></ul>

# Fabrication of a Si solarcell
- project: Fabrication of a crystalline Si p-n junction solar cell
  role: Course project
  duration: Jul 2015 &mdash; Sep 2015
  # url: "#"
  description: <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>The Fabrication was done in the University’s Cleanroom; the process included wafer cleaning, Photolithography, Sputtering, Etching and Ion Implantation.</li><li>The Solar cell was tested for parameters like fill factor, maximum power and efficiency.</li></ul>

# Developed a game on the LPC1768 development board
- project: Developed a game on the LPC1768 development board
  role: Course project
  duration: Feb 2015 &mdash; May 2015
  # url: "#"
  description: <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>The project involved understanding the architecture and capabilities of the Cortex-M3 processor based development board, interfacing the microcontroller with a GLCD Screen, a 3-axis MEMS sensor on the Wii  Nunchuk via I2C etc  and developing a game in Embedded C using Keil Tools.</li></ul>

# Application and Game Development in C++ and Python
- project: Application and Game Development
  role: Personal project
  duration: Jun 2016 &mdash; Aug 2016
  # url: "#"
  description: <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Developed a “Flappy Birds” style game in Python 2.7 using the Pygame library.</li><li>Created a 2D “Space Invaders” game in the Unity 5 environment.</li><li>Created a GUI based application in Python that uses web scraping and a text to speech engine to display and read out the local NEWS and weather forecast (OWM API AND DarkSky API).</li></ul>


# Implementation of an 8-bit Wallace Tree Multiplier
#- project: Implementation of an 8-bit Wallace Tree Multiplier
#  role: Course project
#  duration: Aug 2015
#  description: 
#(Tools: Atlys Spartan 6 FPGA, Xilinx ISE Design Suite, Active HDL Simulation Tool and VHDL)
#• Worked in a team to design and implement an 8-Bit Wallace Multiplier on the FPGA board.
